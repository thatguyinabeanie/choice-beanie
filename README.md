    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/thatguyinabeanie/battle-stadium.git
    cd battle-stadium
    ```

2. Install Ruby:

    Use your favorite version management tool, for exampple [`frum`](https://github.com/TaKO8Ki/frum), a fast Ruby version manager built in Rust.

      asdf ruby install
      rvm install

    docker-compose up -d db # starts postgres db
    ```
